# OpenChart data

## Charts
This folder contains the OpenChart-SE dataset, version 1, with 50 patient charts. These are available in two formats, structured as a .csv file and as separate textfiles for annotation. Note that flaws in the data were not cleaned up so that it simulates what could be encountered when working with data from different EHR systems. All charts have been checked for medical validity by a resident in Emergency Medicine at a Swedish hospital before publication.

## Codebook
The codebook contain information about each variable used. It is in XLSForm-format, which can be re-used in several different applications for data collection.
