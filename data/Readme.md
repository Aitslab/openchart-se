# OpenChart data

## Charts
This folder contains the OpenCart dataset version 1, with 50 patient charts. These are available in two formats, structured as a .csv file and as separate textfiles for annotation. Do note that the data, intentionally, has flaws in it to simulate what could be encountered when working with data from different EHR systems. All charts have been checked for medical validity by a resident in Emergency Medicine before publication.

## Codebook
The codebook contain information about each variable used. It is in XLSForm-format, which can be re-used in several different applications for data collection.
